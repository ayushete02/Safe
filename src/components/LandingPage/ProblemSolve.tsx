All such messages are spams. Spam not only causes huge losses to businesses but individuals too. There is not a single messaging app that promotes such an environment to remain spam-free. By our dapp we are creating such an incentive model that it becomes impossible for the spammers to survive on the dapp while rewarding the receivers to get paid on receiving spam at worst.</p>
